3D model in .fbx format based on the on laser scanning and orthophotos of the full constructed part of the Smart City Zone.

Features
- 3D model in .fbx format based on the laserscanned version of the full constructed part of the Smart City Zone
- Contains all the roads, markings, traffic signs.
- Full, non-editable texture.
- Has elevation.

Limitations
- Roads and textures are not editable (only the traffic signs).
