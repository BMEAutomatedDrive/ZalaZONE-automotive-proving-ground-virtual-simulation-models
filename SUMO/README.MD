Laser scanned and blueprint-based models of the Smart City Zone of the ZalaZONE test track in SUMO network file (.net.xml) format. There are minor deviations from the constructed test track. The laser scanned SUMO project file is limited as it only contains the already constructed part of the Smart City Zone (cca. 30%).

The creation of the OpenDrive map file has been supported through laser scanning made by Baukoord-Europa Ltd. (baukoord.hu/en/).

## Smart City Zone laser scanned

Features
- SUMO model of the constructed part of SmartCity zone.
- Based on laserscanned OpenDrive model. 
- Accurate road width, curvature, special junctions and roundabouts.
- Contains the rules of the traffic.

Limitations
- Not all road types can be modeled.
- No elevetion.
- No GPS coordinates added.

## Smart City Zone construction plan based

Features
- Full SUMO model of the SmartCity zone.
- Contains the rules of traffic.

Limitations
- Not all road types can be modeled.
- No roundabouts.
- No elevetion.
- Not exact replica of the real track.
- No GPS coordinates added.

## Smart City Zone construction plan based - Phase 1 (partial)

Features
- SUMO model of the constructed part of SmartCity zone.
- Based on the construction plan.
- Contains the rules of traffic.
- GPS coordinates added.

Limitations
- Not all road types can be modeled.
- No roundabouts.
- No elevetion.
- Not exact replica of the real track.
