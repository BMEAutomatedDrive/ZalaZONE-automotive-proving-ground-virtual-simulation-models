Laser scanned and blueprint-based models of the Smart City Zone of the ZalaZONE test track (Z-city) in OpenDrive (.xodr) format. The full test track model was created manually in ROD (VIRES own road-network designer software) based on the original plans. There are minor deviations from the constructed test track.
